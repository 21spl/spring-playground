# Spring Security Microprojects

This branch (`spring-security`) contains the microprojects related to **Spring Security**.  

It acts as my personal reference for understanding and experimenting with Spring Security concepts.  

Each microproject demonstrates hands-on exercises, including the default behavior and custom configuration of Spring Security. 

Every microproject has its own folder and README explaining implementation details.
