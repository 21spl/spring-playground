## Objective
To build an application that stores ```Customer``` POJOs(Plain old java objects) in a 
memory-based database.

This means:
- No external database (MySQL/Postgres/etc.) is connected.
- At startup, Spring Boot auto-creates an H2 database in RAM (```jdbc:h2:mem:...```).
- Our Customer entities get stored there.
- When we stop the app â†’ the DB vanishes (all data gone).

## Creating an Entity class
1. Customer class has three attributes: id, firstName, lastName
2. Default constructor exists only for the sake of JPA. We don't use it directly. So marked protected
3. Customer class is annotated with @Entity, indicating that it is a JPA entity.
4. Because no @Table annotation exists, it is assumed that this entity is mapped to a table named Customer
5. id property is marked as @Id so that JPA recognizes it as object's ID (Primary Key)
6. @GeneratedValue(Strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) means, Id will be generated automatically

## Creating a CustomerRepository Interface 

1. Spring Data JPA focuses on using JPA to store data in a relational database
2. The most compelling feature is the ability to create repository interface automatically
   at runtime, from a repository interface
3. CustomerRepository extends the CrudRepository interface
4. The type of entity and ID that it works with are Customer and Long (datatype of customer entity id)
5. So CrudRepository  is specified by generic parameters<Customer, Long>
6. By extending CrudRepository, CustomerRepository inherits several methods for working with Customer persistence
7. Spring Data JPA also lets us define other query methods by declaring their method signature - findByLastName(), findById()
8. In typical java application, we write a class that implements CustomerRepository.
9. But it is the magic of Spring Data JPA which creates an implementation when we run the application

## Creating the Application class

1. This is the class with annotation ```@SpringBootApplication```
2. @SpringBootApplication annotation adds all the following annotations
    - @Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definition for ApplicationContext
    - @EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells spring boot to start adding beans on classpath settings
    - @ComponentScan: Tells spring boot to look for other components, configurations, services in the base package
3. main method uses ```SpringApplication.run()``` method to launch an application
4. To get the output (to the console), we need to set up a logger
5. Then we need to set up some data and use it to generate output
6. We can run the application by using: ```./mvnw spring-boot:run```
7. OR, we can build the JAR file with ```./mvnw clean package``` and then the jar file
    - ```java -jar target/microproject1.jar```





###  CommandLineRunner
In spring boot, a class or bean that implements ```CommandLineRunner``` runs automatically after the application
context is loaded but before the application exits.

Here, we were creating a bean of type CommandLineRunner and run it at startup

The lambda (args) -> {...} is the implementation of CommandLineRunner.run(String... args).
Everything inside runs once when the app starts

It is typically used for:
- Seeding initial data into the database
- Running quick tests when the app starts
- setting up defaults (Say setting up admin credentials initially and granting the role ADMIN)


## Packaging Spring Boot App into JAR (using MAVEN)

Since youâ€™re using Spring Boot + Maven, packaging is super easy because Spring Boot Maven Plugin takes care of it.

#### Step 1. Check pom.xml

Make sure you have the Spring Boot Maven Plugin inside <build>:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

This plugin creates an executable JAR (with dependencies + main class inside).

#### Step 2. Package your app

Run:
```
./mvnw clean package
```
(or on Windows PowerShell)
```
mvnw clean package
```

This will:
- Clean old builds
- Compile your project
- Package it into a JAR

ðŸ‘‰ The JAR will be in:
```
target/microproject1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
#### Step 3. Run the JAR

Now simply run:
```
java -jar target/microproject1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

This will start your Spring Boot application exactly like mvn spring-boot:run, but now itâ€™s in a single portable JAR file
